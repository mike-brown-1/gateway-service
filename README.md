# gateway-service

Simple [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/index.html) 
REST API for experimenting with 
[Spring Cloud Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway).  
This service **DOES NOT** use service discovery.

Check for [compatibility](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-release/wiki/Supported-Versions)
of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
